# Lab: Django CRUD and Forms

## Overview
- Add full CRUD functionality to your bag of tricks by building a Django project that allows Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting.

## Implementation Notes
- A lot of functionality is being added here. But it should still follow the “Django way.” So when in doubt refer back to demo.

## User Acceptance Tests
* Test all Views
* Test Model
  * string representation
  * all fields

## Problem Domain
- Handling forms is a complex business. Consider Django’s admin, where numerous items of data of several different types may need to be prepared for display in a form, rendered as HTML, edited using a convenient interface, returned to the server, validated and cleaned up, and then saved or passed on for further processing.

- Django’s form functionality can simplify and automate vast portions of this work, and can also do it more securely than most programmers would be able to do in code they wrote themselves.

- In this repo, the three distinct parts of the work involved in forms which are handeled by Django are:

  * Preparing and restructuring data to make it ready for rendering
  * Creating HTML forms for the data
  * Receiving and processing submitted forms and data from the client
